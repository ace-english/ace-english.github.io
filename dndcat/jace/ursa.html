	<h3>Ursa Traits</h3>
<em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.<br />
<em><strong>Age. </strong></em>Ursa mature a little faster than most, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.<br />
<em><strong>Alignment. </strong></em>Ursa are commonly found traveling in roving bandit tribes that ruin everything in their direct path. Ursa who grow up in such an enviornment tend towards chaotic evil.<br />
<em><strong>Size. </strong></em>Ursa are somewhat larger and bulkier than most, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.<br />
<em><strong>Speed. </strong></em>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br />
<em><strong>Darkvision. </strong></em>Thanks to your bear blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br />
<em><strong>Menacing.</strong></em> You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.<br />
<em><strong>Relentless Endurance.</strong></em> When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.<br />
<em><strong>Savage Attacks.</strong></em> When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.<br />
<em><strong>Languages. </strong></em>You can speak, read, and write Common and Ursine. Ursine is a harsh, grating language with plenty of roaring. It has no script of its own but is written in the Inu script.</p>
