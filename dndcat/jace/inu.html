	Inu are a small but quickly-growing race of people descended from wolves. Civilized Inu are generally excellent community members, often devout in their religion and excellent craftsmen. However, feral or rogue Inu are far more in tune with their wolven ancestors and can be a serious threat for those who traverse the forest.
	</p><p>

	Inu resemble bipedal canines, with bent knees and nimble hands. Their bodies are covered in fur, but the length and coloration of their coats varies greatly. They may resemble anything from foxes to gray wolves to labradors.They have long, pointed ears, snouts, wet noses, and jagged teeth. An Inu can use his paws just as a human can use his hands. All Inu have tails, of varying size and bushiness.
	</p><p>
	Inu often lure their prey into a trap or an ambush before attacking with bows from the trees.
	Civilized inu prefer to use manufactured weapons over their natural attacks, as they consider it savagery to bloody opponent with their claws and teeth alone. They will only bite when cornered.
	</p><p>
	As part of their ancient religion, devout Inu believe that arcane magic caused the destruction of the world long ago. Most inu will swear to never use it, though they do not begrudge other humanoids who choose to study it. Inu will look down on other inu who take up arcane magic, or any magic not gifted by the gods or forces of nature.

	<strong>Slight Build:</strong> The physical stature of the Inu let them function in many ways as if they were one size category smaller. Whenever an Inu is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as Hide), the Inu is treated as one size smaller if doing so is advantageous to the character. An Inu is also considered to be one size smaller when "squeezing" through a restrictive space. An Inu can use weapons designed for a creature one size smaller without penalty. However, the space and reach of an Inu remain those of a creature of their actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject's size category.

	<strong>Scent:</strong> This extraordinary ability lets a creature detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.
	A creature with the scent ability can detect opponents by sense of smell, generally within 30 feet. If the opponent is upwind, the range is 60 feet. If it is downwind, the range is 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at three times these ranges.<br>
	The creature detects another creature’s presence but not its specific location. Noting the direction of the scent is a move action. If it moves within 5 feet of the scent’s source, the creature can pinpoint that source.<br>
	A creature with the Track feat and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10. The DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.<br>
	Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.<br>
	Water, particularly running water, ruins a trail for air-breathing creatures. Water-breathing creatures that have the scent ability, however, can use it in the water easily.<br>
	False, powerful odors can easily mask other scents. The presence of such an odor completely spoils the ability to properly detect or identify creatures, and the base Survival DC to track becomes 20 rather than 10.
