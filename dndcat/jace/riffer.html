<h1>The Wicked Tale of Widdly Riffer</h1>

<div class="prose">
	<p>
		Born in the small village of Fairborough, Widdly (born Clicker Tongue) wasn't one to follow in his parents' (Slap and Whistle) footsteps of simple printing press operators and calligraphers. Copying the works of others seemed too boring and safe, his father warned him about taking risks with tales of angry gods, but Widdly always questioned the stories and considered them nothing more than fairie tales. "Don't rock the boat, and you'll sail smoothly to your port." his mother warned. <i>Lame,</i> thought Widdly. Even at a young age, Widdly saw villagers live and die their whole time in this ramshackle of mud huts.
	</p><p>
		One day a group of troubadours came to town. He heard their sweeping music and loved it... for a time. Eventually he grew bored of their soft melodies, but as they began to pack up and leave his town, he rushed to the Lute player and begged them to not leave. The Lute player smiled and handed Widdly his oaken instrument. "Go on kid, breath your own music into this village." And so the man went into the hills... with all his sheet music and notes! Widdly had nothing to go on!
	</p><p>
		For a few months, Widdly poked and prodded at the lute. He struck a few chords and a simple melody formed. He didn't know about composition or even notes, he just played what felt good. After a few years of practice, he became exceptional, but he eventually bored of it. He decided to test himself by doing something simple: play faster. Old songs were reborn in his lute, so he played faster. And faster. <i>And faster and faster and faster an-BRAMP!</i> He broke his damned strings again!
	</p><p>
		His friend and only fan, Billy Wayne, suggested that he replace the strings with "Like, uhh, metal, or sumfin'?" Which Widdly did. Finally, in a cold and windy autumn night, he went to the cemetery (which was the only place his parents would let him play, for they hated his music) and in the light of the full moon... <i>RIFFED</i>. The power of the strings and speed of his talons seemed to raise the dead. He felt the very awesome power of hell pulse through his lute, he became the Devil's very spawn that night! <i>Rise, RISE! RISE, WARRIORS OF THE DAMNED!</i> And to Widdly's surprise they actually did! The mounds began to rise as the dead clawed out of their graves. Scared and shocked, Widdly stopped playing. When the sounds of his metal strings faded from the echoes of the forest, the animated bodies rested. <i>Screw this!</i> He thought as he ran back to town.
	</p><p>
		After a few months of poking and prodding, he learned that not all of his songs raised the dead, just that one. He even dared to recreate it, but he could never quite get it right. Maybe he never should.  He did, however, find some of his other songs could cause effects in the real world. Now he mostly spends his time hanging with his only fan, Billy Wayne, outside of the well; causing all kinds of a ruckus and noise. The old folks couldn't even comprehend what the hell those sounds were even supposed to be, such a weird kid! It sounds like... widdly? Widdly wah wah? Either way, that kid's never going anywhere with music like <i>that</i>!
